        <h2> The Congress Party </h2>
        <p>
            As a 130+ year old institution with a large voter base the Congress party still stands tall on its feet even today. Congress has a strong kundali of its own, so to speak, but it goes without saying that the future of the party is intertwined with that of its leaders.

            The 7<sup>th</sup> house denotes partnerships, which will form the centerpiece of politics from Priyanka Gandhi. This is also what she did with the Samajwadi Party in the last UP elections. While she will help Congress gain some lost ground her long term role in the party is not going to be very fruitful.
        </p>

            Priyanka has the abilities to perform better than Rahul in politics but will not be able to save congress due to her current mahadasha of Saturn and . Also, she resists accepting any new ideas and does not want to change her opinions easily. However, it is her strong views and intuition which generally guide her to take vital decisions and stand firm against the opposite views.

        <h2> General Elections 2019 </h2>
        <p>
            The debacle of the Indian National Congress is ubiquitously known. The people now have ambiguity mindset as to the existence of the Congress in India under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. The recent jeopardy in Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand denotes complete inefficient leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
           The party belongs to Cancer Ascendant and Aries Moon sign. The Lagna Lord Jupiter is posited in the 11<sup>th</sup> house along with Venus that gave unprecedented achievement under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi during last 50 years.
</p>
           <p>
However, the success of the party has been sarcastically bleak under the leadership Rahul Gandhi. Even, the people have left the hope of Congress coming back again.
