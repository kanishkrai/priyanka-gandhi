        <h2> General Elections 2019 </h2>
        <p class="beginning">
            From the birth chart of India, the current dasha cycle of Moon and an upcoming dasha cycle of Mars somewhat coincides with that of Modi’s birth chart. It is clear from his and the nation's <em>navmasa</em> that their destinies are currently intertwined and will simply add to his own advantage over his opponents who will have to fight elections tooth and nail with a stronger dasha to be able to defeat him.

            While Modi may form a government again in the 2019 general elections, it is unlikely he would do so without outside support - i.e coalition Government. During his new term he will face several controversies and will be much less autocratic in governance than he has been in the current run. Demonetization and its ill-effects on the Indian economy will haunt him for the rest of his career.
