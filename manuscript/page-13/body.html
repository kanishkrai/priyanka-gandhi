        <h2> Spirituality vs. Politics </h2>
        <p>
        The presence of Ketu with his Sun & Mercury in the eleventh house indicates almost a divine force in the materializing success for his decisions. This placement adds a spiritual & altruistic disposition to him. It is well-known that he had spent many years of his life in ashrams in the search of the self.

          However, since Rahu sits in his 5th House of Higher Learning, Modi's quest for self-actualization was halted half-way and he had to rather walk the troubled route of Indian Politics in order to accomplish something in the more material and tangible world.

            Since his Rahu aspects his 9<sup>th</sup> House of Dharma and the 1<sup>st</sup> House of Self, made him an intelligent politician who is able to take tough stands to accomplish his goals. He is on a spiritual mission to accomplish tasks which are heavenly ordained in the current set of time & in the present context.
