        <h2> Brand Gandhi & Future</h2>
        <p>
        The political fighting with Narendra Modi could be an uphill task for Priyanka Gandhi. Furthermore, the current premier Narendra Modi has been running through the Mahadasha of Moon which is showering power, position, authority and opportunities for global leadership. 
        It will be an extremely cumbersome task for Priyanka Gandhi to jeopardize the position of Narendra Modi during upcoming election in 2019 since Mr. Modi will have the major period of Moon and upcoming period of Mars.

         The year 2019 can be a bolt from the blue for Priyanka Gandhi. So far as Indiaâ€™s future is concerned, it will develop by leaps and bounds as the country has been running through the auspicious Mahadasha of Moon and it will remain till September 2025. The Moon is in own sign in the Cancer that presages that India will craft the new history in the world.
