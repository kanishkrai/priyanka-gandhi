        <h2> Synopsis </h2>
        <p>
            There is a general assumption that Ms. Priyanka Gandhi is a replica of our late primeminister Shrimati Indira Gandhi but this is not true at all. From an astrological standpoint, it is not in Priyanka's stars to be able to cut a prodigious career in politics. She will not be able to save the Indian National Congress from sinking under the aegis of Mr. Rahul Gandhi.

            So the question is: Will Ms. Priyanka assume responsibility and take over the reins of Congress? A look at the natal chart of Priyanka suggests that yes she will do so but what else is in store for her in politics?
        </p>
        <p>
            Priyanka Gandhi is born under the expressive Gemini Ascendant and secretive Scorpio Moon sign. Her Lagna Lord Mercury is conjoined with the 10<sup>th</sup> lord Jupiter along with Sun denoting a political career but only a conflicted one. Planet Mars in the 10th house indicates she has great command over people.
