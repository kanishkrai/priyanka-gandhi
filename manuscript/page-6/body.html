            In Priyanka’s horoscope, Jupiter—the Lord of 10<sup>th</sup> House is placed with the Ascendant Lord forming a strong <em>Rajyoga</em>, i.e. sign of a leader. Jupiter in its own sign in Kendra forms the <em>Hamsa</em> yoga, i.e that of a <em>Mahapurush</em>, indicating that Priyanka is born a natural leader governed by dynamism and spontaneity of a child, but in ways similar to that of her elder brother <a href="8" class="page">Rahul Gandhi</a>.

            In the near term Saturn is going to transit through her 7<sup>th</sup> house over the natal Sun, Mercury and Jupiter bringing in several difficulties and challenges on the domestic front. During this period, with the lordship of the 8th bhava in her natal Saturn, there will also be fulfilment of several promises that are in store for her.
            Overall, there is a combination of stress, spiritualism, stupor and happiness in the horoscope of Priyanka Gandhi.
