    <h2> Personal Life </h2>
        <p>
            In Priyankaâ€™s horoscope, the Lord of 10<sup>th</sup> House Jupiter is placed in the 7<sup>th</sup> House with the Ascendant Lord and forming a strong Rajyoga. Jupiter in its own sign in Kendra is forming Hamsa Yoga, one of the Maha-Purush yoga, which indicates that she is dynamic and spontaneous.

              <p>
            Saturn is going to transit in her 7<sup>th</sup> house and will transit over natal Sun, Mercury and Jupiter. It may bring some disturbances in her married life because of the lordship of the 8th bhava but her natal Saturn has lots of promises for her. Saturn is placed in star of Sun which is the ruler of third house.

            There is also a good combination for spiritualist in the horoscope of Priyanka Gandhi. In both the Rashi chart and Navamsha, the 5<sup>th</sup> lord has gone into the ninth house and is getting the aspect of ninth lord. That's why she is inclined to <em>Vipassana</em> meditation.
