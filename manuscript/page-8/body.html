            The horoscope of Modi falls into Phalguni Nakshatras representing a warrior with a single point of focus just like Arjuna himself. Narendra Modi’s execution of great marketing initiatives like that of <em> Jan Dhan Yojana</em>, <em>Make in India</em> and <em>Digital India</em> reveal a sharp and surgical focus that stems due to presence of Sun, Mercury and Ketu in his 11<sup>th</sup> house in Virgo sign. He will continue to lead the BJP with his charisma and political prowess.

            Another key factor in his birth chart is the presence of Rahu—the "king maker" in his 5<sup>th</sup> house in the sign of Pisces which aspects his 9<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and the Ascendant. These virtues make him a true politician, a hardcore diplomat who can take tough, almost monarch-like positions when required. Such will be their confidence in Modi, for example, that even his campaign trail will be seen as enough to tilt elections in their party's favor.
