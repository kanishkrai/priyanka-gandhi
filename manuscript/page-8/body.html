        <h2> Relationship with Rahul Gandhi </h2>
        <p>
            The lord of the 3<sup>rd</sup> house in the Rahul’s natal chart is Moon, prognosticating that younger sister will have difference of opinion on several matters. These differences however will be shortlived and remain moderate because the lord of the 3<sup>rd</sup> house in Priyanka’s chart is Sun, and is posited in the 7<sup>th</sup> house with the auspicious of Jupiter and Mercury—meaning that she will be adjusting in nature and inclined to choose an inert introverted role instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 3<sup>rd</sup> house in the natal chart of Priyanka Gandhi is very strong and free from malefic affliction. Moreover, the 3<sup>rd</sup> house is also getting auspicious aspect by Jupiter. On the political front is it more likely that Priyanka Gandhi will support and guide Rahul Gandhi from the sidelines than the other way round.
