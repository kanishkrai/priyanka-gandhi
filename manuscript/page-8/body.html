        <h2> Relationship with Rahul Gandhi </h2>
        <p>
            The lord of the 3<sup>rd</sup> house in the Rahul’s natal chart is Moon prognosticating that the younger sister will have several differences of opinion with him. These differences however will be shortlived and remain moderate because the lord of the 3<sup>rd</sup> house in Priyanka’s natal chart is the Sun, and is posited in the 7<sup>th</sup> house with the auspicious of Jupiter and Mercury—meaning that she will be adjusting in nature and inclined to choose an inert introverted role more often.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 3<sup>rd</sup> house in the natal chart of Priyanka Gandhi is very strong and is free from malefic afflictions. It is also graced with an auspicious aspect of Jupiter meaning on the political front it is more likely that Priyanka Gandhi will support and guide Rahul Gandhi from the sidelines than the other way round.
