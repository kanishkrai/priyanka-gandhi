        <h2> Relationship with Rahul </h2>
        <p>
            The people might experience an altogether different theatre in the Gandhi family. There is strong feasibility of having cold war between Rahul and Priyanka due to inefficacy of the leadership by Rahul that dethroned the mighty Congress from the nook and corner of the country.
        </p>
        <p> The lord of 3<sup>rd</sup> house is Moon that rules younger sister in the Rahul’s natal chart which prognosticates difference of opinion with Priyanka. However, the moderate family feud will remain under control since the lord of third house is Sun in the Priyanka’s chart which is posited in the 7<sup>th</sup> house with auspicious Jupiter and Mercury.
        </p>
        <p>
           The 3<sup>rd</sup> house in the natal chart of Priyanka Gandhi is very strong and free from malefic affliction. Moreover, the 3<sup>rd</sup> house is also getting auspicious aspect by Jupiter.
