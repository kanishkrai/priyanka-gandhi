            Priyanka will be going through a period of Antardasha of Mercury from 12<sup>th</sup> March 2020 until 12<sup>th</sup> January 2023. Her planetary positions will not have much impact on her political ambitions due to the Mahadasha of Venus. The general expectation here is that politics is not going bring great results for her until 12<sup>th</sup> March 2024 as her stars are severely eclipsed by the Saturn and Rahu.

           There is some hope for Priyanka in politics even though the Antardasha of Saturn is not in her favor being posited in the 12<sup>th</sup> house. From an astrological standpoint Priyanka will not be able to improve her party's (Congress) fortunes despite the initial enthusiasm. Overall, politics will be a hard nut for her to crack or even to steer Congress which has been sailing on broken boat for some time. The outcome for her in the next general elections will be average.
